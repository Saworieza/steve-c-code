1. Username and email
    Alice and alice@gmail.command
2. keysize
    2048
3. Exp of public key
    2020-11-17 
4. what was created in additon to the keypair
    userID (uid)
5. what is the use revocation certificate in gpg
    It is used by the owner of a PGP key pair to declare publicly that the associated private key should no longer be used for creating digital signatures or decrypting messages

Filter Table refers to the iptables filter table. The iptables filter table is one of the tables provided by the netfilter framework, and is primarily used for packet filtering rules. 

Filter tables have 3 built in chains which are
Input chain - used for packets destined for the local system
Forward chain - used for packets that are being routed through the system. mostly used for systems that are being used as routers or gateways
Output chain - used for locally generated packets leaving the system

What is True about Asymmetric encryption?
a)A message encrypted with the Public Key can only be decrypted with the receiver's appropriate private Key.
b)It uses senders public key to encrypt the message.
c)A same key is used for encryption and decryption.
d)All of the given.

Which is one of the major disadvantages of symmetric encryption?
a) Secure transmission of the secret key
b) It is more time consuming
c) It uses more system resources
d) It is very difficult

Sara has exported her private key in private.key file. Which of the below command she can use to view content of the file:
a)cat private.key
b)cd private.key
c)ls
d)add private.key

In OpenPGP, what is the purpose of a key revocation certificate?
a)To encrypt a message with a revoked key
b)To renew the expiration date of a key
c)To permanently delete a public key from the keyring
d)To declare a public key as compromised or no longer valid

Which of the below command is used to generate key pair in gpg:
gpg --full-generate-key
gpg --key-generate
gpg--keypair
gpg â€“keygen

RSA & RSA (Default): This option prompts GnuPG to generate a key pair suitable for both encryption and digital signatures. It's a versatile choice that allows you to use the key for various purposes, including secure communication and signing messages. It also implies that GnuGPG will use default settings for the RSA key such as a default key size (e.g., 2048 bits) and other parameters.
RSA (sign only): Selecting "RSA (sign only)" indicates that you want to generate an RSA key pair specifically for digital signatures. This key will be optimized for signing messages and documents but won't be suitable for encryption.

Alice created a digital signature using the below command. 
/ # gpg --output signed --sign doc2
/ # gpg --verify signed

gpg: Signature made Fri Nov 20 20:10:06 2020 UTC
gpg:            using RSA key 7A78745F00330...
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3 completes needed: 1 trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0 valid: 1 signed: 0 trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: next trustdb check due at 2020-11-25
gpg: Good signature from "Alice <alice@gmail.com>" [ultimate]

The digital signature provides authentication to the
a) Sender
b) Message
c) Sender and Message
d) None of the mentioned
